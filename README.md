# ��� Guess the Number Game

Welcome to the **Guess the Number Game**! This simple yet addictive gaame challenges you to guess a secret number chosen by the program.

## ��� How It Works

1. **Start the Game**: The program randomly selects a secret number within a defined range (e.g., 1-100).
2. **Make a Guess**: Enter your guess, and the program will tell you if the secret number is **higher** or **lower** than your guess.
3. **Win or Lose**: The game ends when you guess the number correctly or run out of attempts. Good luck!
